## Welcome

This project is a part of my data analysis for my research assistant work. It includes data gathering from multiple sources, visualizations, and regression models. In the analysis tab on the left, you can browse through the process and have a look at the final products for both wind and wave data. The final step includes a regression analysis that is built on all the previous steps.
