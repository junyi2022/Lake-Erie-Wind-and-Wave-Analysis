# MUSA 550 Final Project  

__Lake Erie Wind and Wave Data Analysis and Visulization__  
Analysis of the Relationship between Wave Height and Wind Strength

### Satisfied requirements
1. Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API).
2. It combines data collected from 3 or more different sources.
3. The analysis of the data is reasonably complex, involving multiple steps (geospatial joins/operations, data shaping, data frame operations, etc).
4. You analyze raster data using rasterio, rasterstats, or xarray.
5. You perform a machine learning analysis with scikit-learn as part of the analysis.
6. The project includes multiple interactive visualizations that include a significant interactive component (cross-filtering, interactive widgets, etc)
